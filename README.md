# faceswap-GAN-swap-them-all
A GAN based approach for one model to swap them all.

The following figure illustrates our priliminary results on [VGGFace2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vgg_face2/) dataset (from left to right: source, target, result). We also show some failure cases, which demonstrate limitations of our model for genrerating consistent skin tone, eye-glasses, and expression.
